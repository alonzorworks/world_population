"""Countries with high populations do not tend to have high fertility rates. Population growth is a temporary according to the demographic transition model. 
Succintly the demographic transition model asserts that as countries become more advanced their population's growth rate decreases. \n \n \n 
For example as societies advance infant mortality goes down. This causes parents to have less children because a greater percentage of them will reach adulthood, instead of dying before reaching one year old.
Also as societies industrialize, and advance children become more of a liability than an asset. In a rural country children can be a source of almost free labor. However children who are reared in urbanized countries are more expensive to raise. These children also typically do not bring in income nor food to their parents.
In advanced societies women also have greater access to education and family planning devices. This allows them to be able to postpone starting a family (assuming they choose to have one) and they typically have less children.
\n \n However this does not always describe every country's situation perfectly. For example China's fertility rate is low partially due to  the one child policy that lasted from 1980-2016 according to Britannica. There are tens of millions of more males than females in China, which prompts some parents to endow their sons with expensive living spaces and other trappings in hopes that they can find a wife. Competition is fierce because females there are scarce. Also more Chinese men are opting to find women in other Asian countries due to the aforementioned reasons.
An understanding of supply and demand would make it hard to fault Chinese females and their parents to have high expectations for their suitors. However this does not bode well for China, a country that now offers incentives for married couples to have children.
\n \n This information comes from my repetoire that can be attributted to my coursework in Economics, Human Geography and Economic Demography. Resources explaining phenomena further are included in this drop down section.

chart_explanation("Fertilty Rate vs. Median Age Analysis", """Fertility and median age has a negative correlation. This is because as the population ages, it is more difficult to have children. Young people tend to be more fertile than older people. Older women who have undergone menopause would have great difficulty conceiving though it is technically not impossible.
\n \n Replacement level is considered to be 2.1 children per woman. This is considered replacement level. Replacement level means that the women have enough children to replace both the father and mother. Since the children are younger they will presumably carry on the family's legacy barring an untimely death.
Fertility rate is considered to be 2.1 for a similar reason. Statistically infant mortality has to be factored in by researchers. By having the replacement level at 2.1 the population still replaces  itself after factoring in infant mortality. 
\n \n Median age signifies that about half of  the population is above the median age, and 50% is below it. This  gives a lot more information than the mean which can more easily skewed. With this in mind typically the younger the median age is the higher the fertility rate is. 
This is because a large swath of the country was born recently indicating people are having children. It also signifies that a large number of the population has in their prime child bearing years, or have their most fecund years ahead of them. 
When the median is high it signifies that a large part of the population are most likely done having kids.

\n \n Japan is in population crisis. Their fertility rate for the year 2020 was 1.4 which is one of the lowest in the world. Per the dataset used here they have the highest median population age in the world at 48. This means that the youngest half of the population can include people who are past their most fertile years. This will make it hard for Japan to replenish it's dwindling population. 
This is exacerbated by the fact that Japan nationalistic cultural landscape makes immigrating to the country quite difficult. The BBC had a segment of why Japan has a low fertility rate, its current effects, and how it does not bode well for the island.
